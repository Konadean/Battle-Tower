A spiritual successor to my previous commandline game "Walking Simulator 2021"

Its a turn-based combat game all in commandline where you try to climb as many floors as you can. Featuring a fully functional levlling system, skill system, inventory and items, slightly random but not really enemies that scale with floor progression and some other sutff or something.

To get started, download the files and run `py main.py`, happy climbing!
